Chapter 14 ï¿½ Van Klees workshop
It was a warm evening and the stars shone through a deep blue sky as the Duke's airship descended over Kasteel De Haar. A few minutes latter, just in time for dinner, the Duke strode into the dinning hall. The other residents of the Manor were already gathered to eat, and since Lady Carmine had politely agreed not to assassinate Edward, she now often joined them at the evening meal.

The Duke strode towards Edward with a sense of urgency. "We need to talk my boy," he said, "but first lets eat."

Despite the apparent urgency the Duke proceeded to settle down to a leisurely meal and would say nothing more at the table. It was quite some time before he was replete and suggested to Edward and Captain Legate that they join him in his private study.

Taking a seat each the Duke offered goldfish bowl sized glasses of French brandy, and cigars from the new world, which he'd chanced to picked up in London. Eventually, Edward and the Captain were settled to the Duke's satisfaction and he finally began.

"I take it, things have been uneventful here while I was away?" he asked.

"Nothing of interest to report your Lordship," Legate replied, "though you may like to go through the day logs which I have kept," he added.

"Very well, then I shall tell of my adventures in England. As you know I had various business matters to attend to, but these provide good reason for me to move about the country and ask questions," he drew upon his cigar and blew a ring of blue smoke.

"First I felt it important to try and ascertain to what extent Victor, the Emperor in Parentis, knows of your situation Edward. My first impression at court was he knew nothing of your return and I had hoped to get some word to your mother, but these plans I'm afraid fell short. I also hoped to contact members of the League of the White Rose, but I was unsuccessful in this too. Victor has had ten years to hunt them down and those whom I knew, or suspected of having sympathies with the league, have either disappeared or are too afraid to show their support."

"That was when I made an error for which I hope you will forgive me. It was a calculated risk, one I felt worth taking, but it failed. I thought our cause might be best served if it became known, or at least rumoured that you are alive Edward, and to that end I engaged a couple of trusted agents who began circulating such. It was my hope this would cause your Uncle to make a move, I even hoped, to reconsider his position, but I must confess I underestimated him."

"Which ever way you look at it, it serves our purpose for people to think you alive, to give them a rallying point, something to believe in. However your Uncle's fears that you were not killed in childhood, have now been confirmed, and though he has indicated he never completely believed such, my actions have given him strong reason to react. Not long after I spread the news of your survival a new rumour started, one that certainly came from within the palace walls, that a pretender threatens the Imperial throne. Imperial agents scour the country looking for this pretender and using it as an excuse to carry out some of your Uncles' less savoury orders."

"What I know for sure, is that so far, he does not suspect me of being directly involved, at least no more than he suspects anyone. He does not know your whereabouts, but, he keeps your mother close to him these days and I was unable to visit with my sister alone, nor to get word to her. We are for the time being at least, safe here. We face a new problem, when the time comes, of proving to the world that you are no pretender, Edward," the Duke slumped back in his seat a dejected look on his face.

"I will return to England in a few days time and carry on search the for members of the League, meanwhile you should continue with your studies Edward," the Duke said.

While the Duke's return was a welcome break in the normal routine at De Haar, his disappointing news was far from being so. Never-the-less it set Edward to thinking about the issues of being a statesman. He would indeed need to be well prepared in order to over-throw his Uncle, the Emperor, and with this in mind he applied himself with renewed vigour to his studies.

Along side the arts of war, Captain Legate taught the two boys to ride horse at which Robert proved himself to be marginally the better horseman. A steam car was put at Edward's disposal by the grand Duke and Captain Legate instructed him in its operation, something to which Edward with his experience of engines, readily took too, and whenever he had the time he would conduct the car across the vast Van Hoakfen Estate, sometimes with Rob riding along side and once with the Lady Carmine as his passenger.

The day he rode with Carmine was a warm pleasant summers' day. The afternoon sun had passed its zenith but was yet still high in the sky when they set out. Much of the route took them down leaf lined trails who's roadside trees provided them with dappled shade. Edward was thoroughly enjoying himself, the beautiful Lady Carmine sat beside him, he threw the machine into the corners causing far more steam and hiss than was necessary. If he'd been able to see himself he would have known he was showing off. As they came round a wooded copse on the south side of the estate the steam-car coughed, shuddered and came to an abrupt halt, unseating the passengers, but not with violence enough to throw them to the ground.

Edward jumped from the drivers' seat and walked to the back of the machine scratching his head as he inspected the gauges and meters. He was intent on finding the cause of the problem so it came as a shock to find Lady Carmine standing right behind him.

"You know I could dispatch you right now, with a single blow," she said softly into his ear.

"Then why don't you?" challenged Edward, turning to face her.

She smiled her cold smile at him. "I've been thinking about it. I'm not sure it's my job any more though." she seemed to slump a degree as she said this as if some invisible strength had gone from her and she sat down on the soft grass at the side of the road.

"I was recruited right out of school into to the Ministry of Imperial Security," she continued dreamily, "and sent to Scotland for training. I thought it was all very exciting and romantic at the time. Then I was sent under Imperial edict to find the pretender, and if necessary, kill him. I didn't know about my father's involvement in rescuing the Infante, but now I'm thinking  perhaps the Emperor had my father killed, his death begins to look suspicious to me."

"So I'm no longer the enemy?" asked Edward.

She looked down at the ground between them and said, "Maybe not."

He knelt down and took her hand in his and looked into her eyes. "It's alright, I don't mind that you tried to kill me."

"But now I want to do something to help, to make up for it. I thought I might be allowed to teach you some of the skills I learnt at the Ministry. If you are to defend yourself against assassination you'll need to know some of the tricks of the trade," she suggested.

"I think it's a great idea, but I suppose we will have to talk to captain Legate about it," said Edward.

"So you don't hold it against me?" she asked.

Edward thought a moment. "No not at all. I guess we all do what we have to at the time and that's what you did. I'm just pleased your not intent on killing me any more."

She smiled back at him and for a moment they stood there holding hands and gazing into each others eyes before she pulled away and turned saying, "Perhaps we should get the car running again."

A half hour fiddling with levers and valves and Edward was able to get the machine working again. He leapt up on the drivers seat and set the engine running with a satisfying chug. Lady Carmine climbed up beside him and they set off again on their tour of the estate.

The following day, during morning training, Edward brought up the subject of Lady Carmine instructing him the arts of assassination, to which Captain Legate reluctantly agreed with the condition he was present during such lessons. He did not trust the Baronetess and did not want to risk a demonstration going lethally wrong.

Later, after lunch, when Edward was with Grand Duchess Cathrine in the library studying, she said something to him. "Edward, it occurs to me it must be difficult for you, not having grown up within the royal family. You know, while my husband Leopold was growing up his lineage was mentioned everyday, every staircase has a portrait of some august ancestor or other, the library is  full of medals and awards from the Emperors and Kings of Europe. For Leopold the business of Monarchy, of being royalty, comes as second nature, it has been bread into him from an early age, but you, you were taken from this world. You will need to work hard to come to know the things an Emperor must know, in order to rule well and wisely. Not only are there finer arts, singing, dancing, poetry and so on, but also the arts of statesmanship."

"You must learn what a king expects, and what is expected of a king. You must learn who your friends and enemies are, who to attack, and when, who to ally with and who might betray you. This new life of yours Edward, may be richer and more luxurious than your old life, but do not be deceived, it is more dangerous and more demanding. You must prepare yourself well, it is only a matter of time before you must inevitably confront your Uncle Victor. Use the time you have here with us well, young Edward, it will not last forever."

Edward nodded gravely. He understood what Grand Duchess Cathrine was telling him and he fully intended to make the best use of his time at the castle. It was with this determination that he threw himself into all the lessons that were available to him and he persisted with those skills in which he did not show promise, as well as honing those he did. The grand Duchess words rang true however, and as spring came on Edward received a message from the Duke requesting he join him in London for an important meeting.

Edward and Robert were fencing in the gymnasium when a footman arrived hot and flushed
from his run along the east wing and up the west wing of the castle.

"Your lordship, Proffesor Van Klees requests your presence urgently in his workshop," the footman panted.

"Thanks Gustaff," replied Edward. "Well I'd better trot along and see what the old man has to say," he told Robert taking off his fencing mask and hanging his blade in the rack.

Edward jogged along the wide corridors past the portraits and busts on their ornate wooden stands and through the blue room barely noticing the imposingly delicate chandelier and the exquisite Louis XIV desk and chairs. As he ventured further up the east wing there was an air of neglect, the paintings and statues seemed darker and more foreboding, dust particles hung in the still air and from time to time an unearthly groan or a great clang could be heard coming from the door at the end. Edward knew the housekeeper didn't like coming up here and Isambard actively encouraged the staff to stay away, he didn't like people snooping around the workshop. All of this was familiar to Edward as he cheerfully pushed open the door and strode in.

As usual it was hard to find Isambard amongst the many contraptions and machines which filled the sizeable space. He had grown used to the mechanical beasts and flailing armatures which might leap out at him at any moment. He trod carefully to make sure he didn't step on some important but escaped piece of apparatus and tiptoed his way around a large dark steel egg shaped thing which stood eight feet high and which Edward could neither see nor guess what earthly use it was.

In the far corner of the room Isambard had a row of tables against the wall. Shelves and cabinets of small wooden draws which might contain anything from the tiniest of springs to the largest of bolts, bunches of herbs,  or lumps of rock or jars of powder. Dominated the area was the huge wide cabinet where Isambard kept his drawings and diagrams, well ordered, in shallow, but deep and wide, draws.

As Edward approached the tables he could just make out the figure of the old man hunched over something. Becoming aware of his visitors' presence, Isambard released the diagram he was inspecting and let it roll-up into a loose cylinder of paper which he deftly tightened with his thumb before sliding it carefully back into a protective cardboard tube.

"Ah, there you are," said Isambard, as if the boy had somehow wondered off a while ago and was now returned.

"You sent Gustaff to call me," said Edward.

"Gustaff? I did? Well I must have had a reason. Would you like a cup of tea?" asked the old man.

"I'm fine thank you," replied Edward impatient for the old man to get to the point.

"Now let me see, what was it?" he scratched his white beard thoughtfully, and idly flicked through the lenses he wore mounted on his unusual glasses, a strange looking device, of the Professor's own invention which by an arrangement of small levers allowed him to apply or remove the lenses before his eyes, thus giving him the ability to see things at many times magnification both near and far, or filtered through coloured glass.

"Ah yes, now I recall, a message from Guy, your Uncle the Duke. He was most excited when he spoke to me..."

"He's been here, he's back from England?" interrupted Edward.

"Ah no," replied Isambard. "I fear I am being unclear, your Uncle's message conveyed his excitement, he wishes you to join him in London for a most important matter. You will of course be accompanied by Captain Legate and Robert Badger."

"And Carmine," added Edward.

"You're Uncle was not specific about the young lady," replied Isambard.

"So she can come?"

"If that is what you wish, it is not for me to say who can go where or do what my young friend. Now you are all to travel in disguise. Your Uncle and I have though long and hard about this and we have devised what we think will be an effective cover for you. Let me see," the old man began rummaging through the piles of paper, boxes and bits of machine that were being used as paperweights.

"Ah ha, here it is," he waived a handful of documents at Edward. "Your cover story," he tapped the papers with his finger tip. "You are to be the Young Prince Constantine Prevaclouz III of the Grand Duchy of Swzaskol. The Grand Duchy is an unimportant state in Eastern Europe who's allegiances are unknown and who's ruling class has not been seen in England for a generation. It will be assumed that you have come to see if you can negotiate some kind of alliance, trade agreement, or whatever. This will allow you to mix at the British court without raising suspicion or interest."

"I have instructed the tailor to make appropriate garments for you and your retinue, I suppose I must now instruct the seamstress to create something appropriate for the young Baronetess as well. You will have to construct a story for her, make her your sister or cousin or something and I will have some documents made up for her," Isambard said with a dismissive wave of his hand.

"You must familiarise yourself with your new identities," he continued. "The A.S. Valiant arrives soon, to take you to London, but first I have something for you, a gift of sorts."

Despite his age Isambard moved with a light and sprightly spring to his step and he shot across the room towards a polished cabinet which stood in the far corner. He took a large brass key and fitted it into the closed lid of the cabinet, turned the key and lowered the lid until it was parallel to the floor, forming a table surface. Inside the cabinet lay a sword which Isambard picked up and presented to Edward.

"This may look like an ordinary sword, but it has a deadly secret hidden just here, in the hand-guard," he turned the blade over so Edward could see inside the hand-guard basket constructed from steel rods woven in an intricate pattern.

"See here, where the guard meets the blade, a small ring?"

Edward looked and saw what seemed like the trigger guard on a gun and he said as much.

"Indeed," the old man cried with joy, "you see this is a gun as well. Only three shots mind you, the magazine is cleverly concealed in the handle and the barrel is part of the blade," he indicated with his finger, a small slanted hole near the tip, in the lower part of the blade, where the bullets would exit from.

Turning back to the cabinet Isambard picked up a small box. Opening it he revealed an ornate chronometer on a chain. "This is a most accurate time piece," said Isambard. "The mechanism need only be wound once a week and is, of course, set to Greenwich mean time. But turn it over and on the reverse side is a compass," he turned the watch over to show Edward that by flipping open the base cover, a compass could be revealed. He gave the watch to Edward who carefully put it into his pocket.

"And finally I have this little beauty," the old man held out a highly polished ornate box about the size of his hand. The lid of the box held a relief carving of a scarab beetle. Using a finger to ease up the small latch which held the box closed, Isambard lifted the lid, opening the box towards Edward. On a cushion of silk in a padded slot cut to fit, lay a golden coloured beetle with jewelled eyes, like the one depicted on the box lid, with a strange eye shaped image in a triangular device engraved on its shell. Isambard carefully picked up the mechanical insect and held it out to Edward.

"This is an Eye of Ra beetle from my own workshops," declared Isambard. "Not only is is an exquisite broach but, turn it over and look," he instructed.

Edward turned the beetle over. On its belly, between its legs sat a series of small leavers.

"These are the controls," explained Isambard. "By setting this first set of switches we can give the beetle coordinates to fly to, and a direction to look in," taking the beetle from Edwards' hand Isambard configured the tiny switches with his fingernail then holding the beetle out on the flat palm of his hand he gently depressed the beetle's head. Immediately the mechanism inside the metal insect began to whir in a soft, almost beetle like way. The carapace split open and the two wing like halves of its casing began to flutter with incredible speed. The beetle shot up in the air, then buzzed round in a circle before turning to look at Edward and the Professor then returned to the old man's outstretched hand. He looked at Edward and grinned.

"Now for the clever part," he announced placing the insect on a large piece of paper on the table. He depressed its rear and after a few moments whirring the insect began clacking its legs and scurried back and forth across the sheet of paper leaving a tiny spider trail of black ink behind it. After a while it became clear to Edward that the beetle was drawing an image, a picture of himself and Isambard, standing in Isambard's workshop, looking up at something.

Isambard clapped his hands with glee. "That's quite something isn't it?" he chortled. "Look, that's quite clearly you and me stood there. Look at the expression on your face."

Edward was amazed, he'd never seen anything like it.

"It will need winding each time you use it, with the key from the box, and has enough ink for five or six drawings before it needs refilling. Make sure you wipe its feet so they don't become clogged with old ink," he warned and wiped the feet with a small cloth before placed the wondrous mechanism back in its box.

"You had better be on your way now young Edward, you need to ready yourself and your friends for the trip to London.
