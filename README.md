The League of the White Rose

A novel by Lucsan/L.D.Tennant

This is the editorial file set for the book.

With League of the White Rose I am attempting to bring together one of the oldest technologies known to man, writing, with one of the newest, computing.

The hurdle in this project is the techknow required to setup git, get a branch and push it back to the repo.

Is it even possible for artists to cross the divide and gain some techknow or techies to understand the finer subtleties of poetry?

I believe it is.

This is an open invitation to help shape The League of the White Rose with Editorial input.

The work is complete in the sense that it has been written, however it now requires editing and type checking (spellink, grammer, punctuation, etc).

Please note the copyright of this work and its edits remains the property of L. D. Tennant.

Hints and Tips

Here you can read the most recent version of the book online. If you have pledged enough to edit the book you will need to sign up to github (an email address , user name and password are all that is required).

I will then add you to the LOTWR project as an editor and you can 'pull' (download) the master 'branch' (a copy) of the book. This will contain all the chapters.

You need to install GIT on your computer, (help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) is an excellent resource for this, and (depending on your OS) this is usually as easy as installing any other application.

Next you pick a suitable place in your computer (ie: folder/directory) to keep the book and clone the master branch.

Now you have a copy of the book on your machine, and any changes you make to it are noted by GIT. Ideally you create a branch of your own (called say, your github user name), which is still a copy of the master branch, but this is your branch which you can edit and submit.

Once you have made an edit and are satisfied with it, you 'commit' (save) it, then 'push' (upload) your branch to the remote repository (ie: the github LOTWR site).

I will be automatically notified of your 'commit', and you can request a merge. If your edit is good I will then merge it into the main text (master branch).

You can then update your branch, which will then include your accepted changes and any edits made by other editors. It is always a good idea to update your branch before making an edit to ensure you are working on the absolute super latest version of the book.
