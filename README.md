The League of the White Rose 

A novel by L.D.Tennant

This is the editorial file set for the book.

With League of the White Rose I am attempting to bring together one of the oldest technologies known to man, writing, with one of the newest, computing.

The hurdle in this project is the techknow required to setup git, get a branch and push it back to the repo.

Is it even possible for artists to cross the divide and gain some techknow or techies to understand the finer subtleties of poetry?

I believe it is.

This is an open invitation to help shape The League of the White Rose with Editorial input.

The work is complete in the sense that it has been writen, however it now requires editing and type checking (spellink, grammer, punctuation, etc)
